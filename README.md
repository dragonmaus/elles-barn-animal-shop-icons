**This mod uses assets from Elle's *Old Barn Animals* and *New Barn Animals* mods (found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1960) and [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3167), respectively).** It was created because Elle's mods do not accomodate for animals that are turned off when patching the shop icons.
